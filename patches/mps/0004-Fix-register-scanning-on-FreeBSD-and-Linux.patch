Subject: [PATCH 4/6] Fix register scanning on FreeBSD and Linux

Author: Richard Brooksby <rb@ravenbrook.com>
Date:   Mon Jan 16 23:21:04 2023 +0000

    Catch-up merge master into branch/2020-09-01/regscan to get full CI build and test, and prepare for review and merge.

Author: Gareth Rees <gdr@ravenbrook.com>
Date:   Tue Jun 4 14:09:05 2019 +0100

    Restore assembly code for spilling callee-save registers.

    This code was previously removed in change 194595 but the result was
    not reliable as noted in job004158.
